> Grid

Project developed using animation styles and grid concepts, focused on responsive layout.

The page was made for devices with different screen widths. It has two breakpoints: 700px and 900px.

> Mobile Version

At first we have the mobile version, that brings a display grid applied to the cards section,
with flex direction column positioning the cards one below the other.
